Tablefunc Extension No Longer Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changes in the behavior of the connectby function in PostgreSQL 9.5
have prompted its removal from the database.  It is easier for
Evergreen to maintain compatibility with previous versions of
PostgreSQL without this function.

By eliminating the use of the connectby function, we eliminate the
requirement for the tablefunc database extension.  It is no longer
installed when the database is created.  If you are upgrading and wish
to remove it from your database, you may run the following statement
in the database to drop it:

 DROP EXTENSION tablefunc;
