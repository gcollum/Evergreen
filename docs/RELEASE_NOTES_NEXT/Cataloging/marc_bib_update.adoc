Selectable Bibliographic Source Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
During vandelay, the bib source has always recorded the record source,
the time of the update and the identity of the user associated with the 
operation.  This is not really desired for match-only merges.

This feature provides a way to control whether the bib source data 
is updated or not.

In MARC Import, select the "Merge / Overlay" tab.  Each entry in the table has 
a value in the new "Update bib. source" column. If that value is "true", then 
the bib source data will be updated.

The two system-defined entries have been pre-set to appropriate values (Full Overlay = true;
Match-Only Merge = false).
